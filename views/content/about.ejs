          My name is Jonathan Lee, born and raised in Toronto, Ontario Canada. I have always had a love of video games
          but my first love was science especially Biology. Nowadays I program games, do web development and generally
          enjoy coding, enjoy creation and gameplay design.

    <p>I am a new graduate of Centennial College
      where I studied Software Engineering specializing in Interactive Gaming.
      There I learned various programming languages such as C#, Java, JavaScript and HTML,
      these languages were used with Unity 3D, Visual Studio, Eclipse and Android Studio
      providing me the ability to create 2D/3D games, mobile and enterprise applications
      as well as utilize agile methodologies during these projects.

    <p>
      While pursuing my studies I had the opportunity to work with SmokeBomb Entertainment
      where I used these skills to produce game prototypes for a new peripheral device.
      I learned communication, teamwork, time management, critical thinking and game design creativity.
